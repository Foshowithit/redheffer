  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    The Red Heifer is an ancient biblical element of Jewish ritual purification, described in the Book of Numbers (Chapter 19). According to tradition, a completely red, unblemished female cow must be sacrificed and its ashes used to purify people and sacred objectsâ€”especially before entering the Temple in Jerusalem. This ritual has not been performed for nearly 2,000 years.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    The <strong>Temple Institute</strong>, based in Jerusalem, is an organization dedicated to preparing for the rebuilding of the <strong>Third Temple</strong>, a central place of worship in Jewish tradition that once stood on the Temple Mount. The Institute has recreated sacred vessels, priestly garments, and even trained individuals for future Temple service.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300">
    In 2022, five red heifers were flown from Texas to Israel under the supervision of Jewish and Christian groups. As of 2025, two of these heifers remain viable candidates for the purification ritual, which is seen by many as a key milestone toward enabling the return of Temple worship. These developments are closely watched by religious groups, political analysts, and prophecy-focused communities around the world.
